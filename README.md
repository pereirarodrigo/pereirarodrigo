I’m Rodrigo Pereira Cruz, a cognitive scientist and AI researcher from 🇧🇷 Brazil, currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the University of Essex.

🧠 My work lives at the intersection of **AI**, **cognitive science**, and **computational neuroscience** - where I explore how intelligence *emerges*, *adapts*, and *self-organises*.

While I started within traditional AI methods, my trajectory naturally led me toward **neuro-inspired systems**, **probabilistic reasoning**, and **intrinsic learning mechanisms**. I believe that building truly intelligent systems requires more than brute force - it demands understanding how learning itself unfolds.

## 🔍 Research focus

- **Cognitive modelling** - using RL and probabilistic models to simulate cognitive processes.
- **Intrinsic curiosity and meta-learning** - exploring how agents self-motivate and adapt over time.
- **Spiking neural networks and neuron models** - bridging bio-realism and machine learning.
- **Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)** - modelling distributed, emergent behaviours.
- **Imitation and inverse RL** - capturing expert-like behavior and learning from it.
- **Gaussian processes and uncertainty-aware systems** - making learning robust, explainable, and grounded.

## 💡 Current initiatives

🧬 Exploring embodied cognition and perceptual emergence through RL and neuro-inspired architectures.

🧠 Independent research projects (including my first preprint on Zenodo) focused on integrating RL into cognitive science frameworks.

🌍 Building bridges with European labs working in cognitive systems, neuro-symbolic AI, and adaptive learning.
