I’m Rodrigo Pereira Cruz, an independent scholar from 🇧🇷 Brazil, currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the University of Essex.

🧠 My work lives at the intersection of **AI** and **metaphysics**, with notable influences from **cognitive science** and **computational neuroscience**. I seek to explore the underlying conditions that allow for not only consciousness and intelligence, but of ontology itself, to arise - all from an *emergentist* and *self-organising* perspective with notable influences from Buddhist epistemology.

---

## 🔍 Academic focus

My main interest lies in **generative meta-formalisms**, systems that allow for the self-dictated and emergent generation of other systems, mostly ontological in origin and which may range from reality itself to the underlying pillars of cognition.

---

## 🌐 Let's connect

📫 I'm always open to academic exchanges or just a good conversation about intelligence and metaphysics.
