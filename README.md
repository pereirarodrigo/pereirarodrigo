I’m Rodrigo Pereira Cruz, an independent scholar from 🇧🇷 Brazil, currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the University of Essex.

🧠 My work lives at the intersection of **AI** and **metaphysics**, with notable influences from **cognitive science** and **computational neuroscience** - where I explore not only how the mind interacts with reality itself from an *emergentist* and *self-organising* perspective, but the very foundations of existence itself.

---

## 🔍 Research focus

- **Ontology** - the study of being and existence.
- **Neural metaphysics** - how the mind perceives, and interacts with, reality itself.
- **Existential metaphysics** - the nature of being and existence.

---

## 💡 Current initiatives

🧬 Exploring the very definitions of reality itself and ascertaining how the human mind perceives that which it cannot name.

---

## 🌐 Let's connect

📫 I'm open to research collaborations, academic exchanges, or just a good conversation about intelligence and metaphysics.
