## Overview

:wave: Hello! My name is Rodrigo and I'm a brazilian computer scientist. I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science degree from the Universidade Cidade de São Paulo (UNICID), and I'm currently working towards obtaining my specialization degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais (PUC Minas).

## Interests

I'm passionate about artificial intelligence, with emphasis on machine learning and its different approaches to problem solving: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. I'm also very interested in deep learning (i.e. neural networks) and its applications, such as in robotics, self-driving cars, computer vision and natural language processing.

As I'm interested in both the theoretical and practical applications of AI, I make heavy use of programming to work on projects, with the main tools I use being the Python and R programming languages, with a clear predominance of the former, where I mainly use the following libraries:

* Scikit-learn;
* NumPy;
* PyTorch;
* Transformers;
* Gensim;
* Pandas;
* SciPy.

I'm currently focused on the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus in the following subjects: topic modelling, natural language understanding and generation (NLU and NLG) and transformers (GPT-2, GPT-Neo and BERT).
