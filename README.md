# Overview

:wave: Hello! My name is Rodrigo and I'm a brazilian computer scientist. 

# Interests

I'm fully focused in the academic world, where I'm currently interested in (and researching about):

* Spiking neural networks;
* Reinforcement learning;
* Robotics.

This list is not definitive, however, as my work tends to rely on other things that I *usually* tend to not interact with (e.g. concepts from electrical engineering in spiking neural networks).
