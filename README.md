## Overview

:wave: Hello! My name is Rodrigo and I'm a brazilian computer scientist. I've obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Science at the Universidade Cidade de São Paulo (UNICID), and I'm currently working towards obtaining a M.Sc. degree in either computer science or information systems.

## Interests

I'm passionate about, and fully focused, in the academic world. I have a deep interest in artificial intelligence, more specifically in computational intelligence, which is a subfield of AI that's mainly concerned about a biologically-inspired approach to machine intelligence. As of now, I'm currently interested in (and researching about):

* Spiking neural networks;
* Computational learning theory;
* Approximate reasoning;
* Reinforcement learning;
* Robotics.

This list is not definitive, however, as my work tends to rely on other things that I *usually* tend to not interact with (e.g. concepts from electrical engineering in spiking neural networks). The main programming languages I use for my projects and research are Python (mainly) and R, with the tools that I use for each of them depending greatly on what I'm working on.

## Contact information

The easiest way to reach out to me is through the e-mail provided in my GitHub account page (pereirarodrigocs@gmail.com).
