## Overview

:wave: Hello! My name is Rodrigo and I'm a brazilian computer scientist. I received my B.Sc. degree from the Universidade Cidade de SÃ£o Paulo (UNICID), and I'm currently working towards obtaining a M.Sc. degree in computer science when possible.

## Interests

I'm passionate about artificial intelligence, with emphasis on machine learning and its different approaches to problem solving: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. I'm also very interested in deep learning (i.e. neural networks) and its applications, such as in robotics, self-driving cars, computer vision and natural language processing.

As I'm interested in both the theoretical and practical applications of AI, I make heavy use of programming to work on projects, with the main tools I use being the Python and R programming languages, with a clear predominance of the former, where I mainly use the following libraries:

* Scikit-learn;
* NumPy;
* PyTorch;
* Keras;
* XGBoost;
* Pandas;
* SciPy;
* OpenAI Gym.
